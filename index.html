    <h1>EVERYDAY GIT</h1>
    <h2>What is Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
        <br>It provides a structured and organized way to manage codebases, track changes, collaborate with others, and
        maintain the integrity of projects over time. there are other version control system like git such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subversion (SVN)</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
        <li>Perforce (helix core)</li>


        <p>Sit back and enjoy as I take you through Git and Github</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p>Before we move to the next step, you need to Download and install Git on your machine. <br> You can check if it
        is installed by going to your command prompt and writing <b><i>git -v</i></b> <br> To download and install Git,
        begin by visiting the Git website at <a href="https://git-scm.com/.">https://git-scm.com/.</a><br> On the
        website, locate the
        prominent download button
        and click on it to initiate the download of the Git installer tailored to your operating system. Once the
        download completes, navigate to the downloaded installer file and double-click on it to launch the installation
        process. Follow the prompts provided by the installation wizard, which may include options to customize the
        installation according to your preferences. Generally, the default settings should suffice for most users. After
        completing the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type <mark>git --version</mark> to verify
        that
        Git was
        installed correctly. This command will display the installed version of Git, confirming the successful
        installation. With Git now installed on your computer, you're all set to begin using it for version control and
        managing your projects' source code.

    </p>
    <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
    <p>Configuring Git involves setting up your identity (name and email), configuring your editor preferences, and
        possibly other settings like default branch names and aliases.</p>

    <h2>Intializing a Git repository</h2>
    <p>A Git repository is essentially a storage location where Git keeps all the metadata and objects that represent
        the history and content of a project. It serves as the central hub for tracking changes to files, recording
        their history, and enabling collaboration among multiple developers.</p>
    <p>Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your project files are located. You can use
        the <mark>cd command</mark> to navigate to the directory.</p>
    <p>Once you're in the project directory, use the following command to initialize a Git repository <mark>Git
            init</mark> as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
    <img src="cd and git init.jpeg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to initialize git">
    <p>This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git directory that
        contains all of Git's metadata and configuration files.</p>
    <img src="git in folder.jpeg" alt="screenshot showing git in folder after initializing">

    <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p> After initializing the repository, you can start adding your project files to it. You can do this using
        the<mark> git add</mark> command followed by the names of the files you want to add.</p>
    <p>But before we add, we need to make sure that the files to be added are correct by using the <mark>git
            status</mark>command as shown in the screenshot below: </p>
    <img src="git add.jpeg" alt="screenshot of adding files to be committed">
    <p>the staging area in Git allows you to prepare and organize changes before committing them to the repository,
        providing granular control over the versioning process and ensuring that only the desired modifications are
        included in each commit. It's a powerful feature that helps maintain a clean and organized project history.
    </p>
    <p>tracked files are those that Git actively monitors and includes in the project's version history, while untracked
        files are not yet part of the repository's history and require explicit action (such as git add)</p>

    <h2>Comitting changes</h2>
    <p> Once you've added your files, you can make your first commit to the repository using the<mark> git commit
        </mark> command. This command records a snapshot of the current state of your project files in the repository's
        history. You'll also need to provide a commit message to describe the changes you're committing.</p>
    <p>Writing good commit messages is essential for maintaining a clear and informative project history. Here are some
        best practices for crafting effective commit messages:
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Use a Descriptive Title:</b> Start your commit message with a brief, descriptive title that summarizes
            the
            changes in the commit. The title should be concise but informative, providing a high-level overview of the
            commit's purpose.</li>
        <li><b>Provide Context:</b> After the title, include a blank line followed by a more detailed description of the
            changes.This description should provide context for the changes, explaining why they were made and how they
            affect the project.</li>
        <li><b>Keep It Concise:</b> While it's important to provide enough detail to understand the changes, avoid
            writing
            overly long commit messages. Aim for clarity and brevity, focusing on the most important aspects of the
            commit.</li>
        <li><b> Use Imperative Mood:</b> Write commit messages in the imperative mood, as if you're giving a command.
            For
            example, use phrases like "Add feature", "Fix bug", or "Update documentation". This helps maintain
            consistency and clarity in commit messages.</li>
        <li><b>Be Specific:</b> Be specific about what changes were made in the commit. Instead of vague statements like
            "Updated code", provide specific details such as "Refactor authentication logic" or "Fix formatting in
            README".</li>
        <li> <b>Reference Issues or Tickets:</b> If your project uses issue tracking or ticketing systems (e.g., GitHub
            issues,
            Jira), include references to relevant issues or tickets in your commit messages. This helps tie commits to
            specific tasks or problems and provides additional context for future readers.</li>
        <li><b>Use Bullet Points for Lists:</b> If your commit includes a list of changes or tasks, use bullet points to
            list
            them clearly and concisely.</li>
        <li><b>Proofread:</b> Before finalizing your commit message, take a moment to proofread it for typos, grammar
            errors,
            and clarity. A well-written commit message reflects positively on the quality of your work and makes it
            easier for others to understand your changes.</li>
    </ol>

    </p>

    <p>To view past commits in a Git repository, you can use the<mark> git log</mark> command.</p>
    <p>To go back to a particular commit in Git, you can use the<mark> git checkout </mark> along with the commit hash
        or a reference to the commit (such as a branch name or a tag).</p>
    <p>below is a screenshot of how to go about it</p>
