    <h1>EVERYDAY GIT</h1>
    <h2>What is Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
        <br>It provides a structured and organized way to manage codebases, track changes, collaborate with others, and
        maintain the integrity of projects over time. there are other version control system like git such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subversion (SVN)</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
        <li>Perforce (helix core)</li>


        <p>Sit back and enjoy as I take you through Git and Github</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p>Before we move to the next step, you need to Download and install Git on your machine. <br> You can check if it
        is installed by going to your command prompt and writing <b><i>git -v</i></b> <br> To download and install Git,
        begin by visiting the Git website at <a href="https://git-scm.com/.">https://git-scm.com/.</a><br> On the
        website, locate the
        prominent download button
        and click on it to initiate the download of the Git installer tailored to your operating system. Once the
        download completes, navigate to the downloaded installer file and double-click on it to launch the installation
        process. Follow the prompts provided by the installation wizard, which may include options to customize the
        installation according to your preferences. Generally, the default settings should suffice for most users. After
        completing the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type <mark>git --version</mark> to verify
        that
        Git was
        installed correctly. This command will display the installed version of Git, confirming the successful
        installation. With Git now installed on your computer, you're all set to begin using it for version control and
        managing your projects' source code.

    </p>
    <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
    <p>Configuring Git involves setting up your identity (name and email), configuring your editor preferences, and
        possibly other settings like default branch names and aliases.</p>

    <h2>Intializing a Git repository</h2>
    <p>A Git repository is essentially a storage location where Git keeps all the metadata and objects that represent
        the history and content of a project. It serves as the central hub for tracking changes to files, recording
        their history, and enabling collaboration among multiple developers.</p>
    <p>Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your project files are located. You can use
        the <mark>cd command</mark> to navigate to the directory.</p>
    <p>Once you're in the project directory, use the following command to initialize a Git repository <mark>Git
            init</mark> as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
    <img src="cd and git init.jpeg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to initialize git">
    <p>This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git directory that
        contains all of Git's metadata and configuration files.</p>
    <img src="git in folder.jpeg" alt="screenshot showing git in folder after initializing">

    <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p> After initializing the repository, you can start adding your project files to it. You can do this using
        the<mark> git add</mark> command followed by the names of the files you want to add.</p>
    <p>But before we add, we need to make sure that the files to be added are correct by using the <mark>git
            status</mark>command as shown in the screenshot below: </p>
    <img src="git add.jpeg" alt="screenshot of adding files to be committed">
    <p>the staging area in Git allows you to prepare and organize changes before committing them to the repository,
        providing granular control over the versioning process and ensuring that only the desired modifications are
        included in each commit. It's a powerful feature that helps maintain a clean and organized project history.
    </p>
    <p>tracked files are those that Git actively monitors and includes in the project's version history, while untracked
        files are not yet part of the repository's history and require explicit action (such as git add)</p>

    <h2>Comitting changes</h2>
    <p> Once you've added your files, you can make your first commit to the repository using the<mark> git commit
        </mark> command. This command records a snapshot of the current state of your project files in the repository's
        history. You'll also need to provide a commit message to describe the changes you're committing.</p>
    <p>Writing good commit messages is essential for maintaining a clear and informative project history. Here are some
        best practices for crafting effective commit messages:
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Use a Descriptive Title:</b> Start your commit message with a brief, descriptive title that summarizes
            the
            changes in the commit. The title should be concise but informative, providing a high-level overview of the
            commit's purpose.</li>
        <li><b>Provide Context:</b> After the title, include a blank line followed by a more detailed description of the
            changes.This description should provide context for the changes, explaining why they were made and how they
            affect the project.</li>
        <li><b>Keep It Concise:</b> While it's important to provide enough detail to understand the changes, avoid
            writing
            overly long commit messages. Aim for clarity and brevity, focusing on the most important aspects of the
            commit.</li>
        <li><b> Use Imperative Mood:</b> Write commit messages in the imperative mood, as if you're giving a command.
            For
            example, use phrases like "Add feature", "Fix bug", or "Update documentation". This helps maintain
            consistency and clarity in commit messages.</li>
        <li><b>Be Specific:</b> Be specific about what changes were made in the commit. Instead of vague statements like
            "Updated code", provide specific details such as "Refactor authentication logic" or "Fix formatting in
            README".</li>
        <li> <b>Reference Issues or Tickets:</b> If your project uses issue tracking or ticketing systems (e.g., GitHub
            issues,
            Jira), include references to relevant issues or tickets in your commit messages. This helps tie commits to
            specific tasks or problems and provides additional context for future readers.</li>
        <li><b>Use Bullet Points for Lists:</b> If your commit includes a list of changes or tasks, use bullet points to
            list
            them clearly and concisely.</li>
        <li><b>Proofread:</b> Before finalizing your commit message, take a moment to proofread it for typos, grammar
            errors,
            and clarity. A well-written commit message reflects positively on the quality of your work and makes it
            easier for others to understand your changes.</li>
    </ol>

    </p>

    <p>To view past commits in a Git repository, you can use the<mark> git log</mark> command.</p>
    <p>To go back to a particular commit in Git, you can use the<mark> git checkout </mark> along with the commit hash
        or a reference to the commit (such as a branch name or a tag).</p>

    <h1>BRANCHES</h1>
    <h2>What is a Branch</h2>
    <p>In Git, branches are parallel lines of development that allow multiple changes to be worked on simultaneously
        without interfering with each other. Each branch represents an independent line of development, with its own set
        of commits and version history. Here's why branches are important:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Isolation of Changes:</b> Branches provide a way to isolate changes and work on them independently of
            each other. This allows developers to focus on specific features, bug fixes, or experiments without
            affecting the main codebase.</li>
        <li><b>Parallel Development:</b> With branches, multiple developers can work on different features or fixes
            concurrently. Each developer can create their own branch to work on their changes, and these branches can
            later be merged back into the main codebase once the changes are ready.</li>
        <li><b>Experimentation and Testing:</b> Branches offer a safe space for experimentation and testing. Developers
            can create branches to try out new ideas or approaches without impacting the stability of the main codebase.
            If the experiment is successful, the changes can be merged into the main codebase; otherwise, the branch can
            be discarded.</li>
        <li><b> Versioning and Release Management:</b> Branches play a crucial role in versioning and release
            management. They allow for the creation of release branches to stabilize code for a release, hotfix branches
            to quickly address critical issues in production, and feature branches to develop new features separately
            from ongoing development.</li>
        <li><b>Collaboration and Code Review:</b> Branches facilitate collaboration among team members by providing a
            mechanism for sharing changes and reviewing code. Pull requests or merge requests are often used to propose
            and review changes before they are merged into the main codebase, allowing for feedback and ensuring code
            quality.</li>
        <li><b>Rollback and Recovery:</b> In the event of a mistake or unforeseen issue, branches provide a way to
            rollback changes and recover to a previous state. By creating branches for each set of changes, developers
            can easily revert to a known good state without affecting other ongoing work.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a branch</h2>
    <p>Creating a branch in Git is a straightforward process. Here's how to do it:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Open Terminal or Command Prompt: </b> to the directory of your Git repository using the terminal or
            command prompt.</li>
        <li><b>Choose a Descriptive Branch Name: </b> creating a branch, decide on a descriptive name that reflects the
            purpose of the branch.</li>
        <li><b> Run the git branch Command:</b> To create a new branch, use the <mark>git branch </mark> followed by the
            desired branch name.</li>
        <li><b>Switch to the New Branch (Optional):</b> If you want to switch to the newly created branch immediately,
            you can use the <mark>git checkout</mark> command followed by the branch name. </li>
        <li><b>Verify the New Branch:</b> To verify that the branch was created successfully, you can use the <mark>git
                branch command without any arguments.</mark> This command lists all branches in the repository, with an
            asterisk (*) next to the current branch</li>
    </ol>

    </p>
    <img src="creating branch.jpeg" alt="screenshot of how branches are created">

    <h2>Viewing all branches</h2>
    <p> you can use the<mark> git branch command without any arguments.</mark> This command lists all branches in the
        repository, with an asterisk (*) next to the current branch as shown below
        :</p>
    <img src="git branch.jpeg" alt="">

    <h2>Switching Active Branches</h2>
    <p>If you want to switch to the newly created branch immediately,
        you can use the <mark>git checkout</mark> command followed by the branch name as shown below:</p>
    <img src="git checkout.jpeg" alt="screenshot showing how active branches are switched">

    <h2>Merging a branch</h2>
    <p>To merge branches in Git using a command, you can use the<mark> git merge</mark> command. Here's how:
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Checkout the Branch to Merge Into:</b> First, ensure you're in the branch you want to merge changes
            into. You typically merge changes into the main branch, such as main or master. You can switch to the branch
            using the git checkout command.</li>
        <li><b>Run the git merge Command:</b> Once you're in the branch you want to merge into, use the git merge
            command followed by the name of the branch you want to merge.This command merges the changes from the
            specified branch into the current branch (e.g., main).</li>
        <li><b>Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Any):</b> If there are any merge conflicts between the branches, Git will
            pause the merge process and prompt you to resolve them manually. Git will indicate which files have
            conflicts, and you'll need to edit the files to resolve the conflicts. After resolving the conflicts, you'll
            need to add the files to the staging area using git add and then commit the merge using git commit.</li>
        <li><b>Complete the Merge:</b> Once you've resolved any merge conflicts, commit the merge to complete the
            process. If there are no conflicts, Git will automatically create a merge commit with both sets of changes
            combined.</li>
        <li><b>Verify the Merge:</b> After completing the merge, verify that the changes from the merged branch are now
            incorporated into the target branch. You can use <i>git log</i> to review the commit history or inspect the
            files in your working directory to confirm that the changes have been merged successfully.</li>

    </ol>

    </p>

    <h2>Deleting a branch</h2>
    <p>To delete a branch in Git, you can use the<mark>git branch command with the -d or -D option</mark>, followed by
        the name of the branch you want to delete. Here's how:</p>
    <img src="git delete.jpeg" alt="screenshot showing how to delete a branch">

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Once you're comfortable with branching and merging in Git, the next step is to explore how Git works with remote
        repositories, like GitHub or GitLab. These platforms let you store your code online and collaborate with others.
        You'll want to learn how to share your changes with others by pushing them to a remote repository and how to
        bring in changes from others by pulling them. It's also helpful to understand how to use features like pull
        requests for reviewing code before it's merged. Additionally, you can dive into different workflow strategies
        and learn about tools like hooks, which automate tasks, or Git LFS, which helps with large files. By learning
        these concepts, you'll become more proficient in managing your code and collaborating effectively with others.
