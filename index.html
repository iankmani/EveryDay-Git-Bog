    <h1>EVERYDAY GIT</h1>
    <h2>What is Git</h2>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
        <br>It provides a structured and organized way to manage codebases, track changes, collaborate with others, and
        maintain the integrity of projects over time. there are other version control system like git such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subversion (SVN)</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
        <li>Perforce (helix core)</li>


        <p>Sit back and enjoy as I take you through Git and Github</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p>Before we move to the next step, you need to Download and install Git on your machine. <br> You can check if it
        is installed by going to your command prompt and writing <b><i>git -v</i></b> <br> To download and install Git,
        begin by visiting the Git website at <a href="https://git-scm.com/.">https://git-scm.com/.</a><br> On the
        website, locate the
        prominent download button
        and click on it to initiate the download of the Git installer tailored to your operating system. Once the
        download completes, navigate to the downloaded installer file and double-click on it to launch the installation
        process. Follow the prompts provided by the installation wizard, which may include options to customize the
        installation according to your preferences. Generally, the default settings should suffice for most users. After
        completing the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and type <mark>git --version</mark> to verify
        that
        Git was
        installed correctly. This command will display the installed version of Git, confirming the successful
        installation. With Git now installed on your computer, you're all set to begin using it for version control and
        managing your projects' source code.

    </p>
    <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
    <p>Configuring Git involves setting up your identity (name and email), configuring your editor preferences, and
        possibly other settings like default branch names and aliases.</p>

    <h2>Intializing a Git repository</h2>
    <p>A Git repository is essentially a storage location where Git keeps all the metadata and objects that represent
        the history and content of a project. It serves as the central hub for tracking changes to files, recording
        their history, and enabling collaboration among multiple developers.</p>
    <p>Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where your project files are located. You can use
        the <mark>cd command</mark> to navigate to the directory.</p>
    <p>Once you're in the project directory, use the following command to initialize a Git repository <mark>Git
            init</mark> as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
    <img src="cd and git init.jpeg" alt="This is a screenshot showing how to initialize git">
    <p>This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory, creating a hidden .git directory that
        contains all of Git's metadata and configuration files.</p>

    <h2>Adding files to the staging area</h2>
    <p> After initializing the repository, you can start adding your project files to it. You can do this using
        the<mark> git add</mark> command followed by the names of the files you want to add.</p>
    <p>But before we add, we need to make sure that the files to be added are correct by using the <mark>git
            status</mark>command as shown in the screenshot below: </p>
